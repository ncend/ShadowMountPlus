/*
 * Mount profiles and cache layers
 * ================================================================
 *
 * LVD geometry
 * ------------
 * sector_size is the logical sector exported by /dev/lvdN. It controls BIO
 * alignment and is not a filesystem allocation block. ShadowMount defaults to
 * 512 bytes for exFAT and 4096 bytes for UFS/PFS.
 *
 * secondary_unit is the LVD mapping/split granularity. The optimized profile
 * uses 64 KiB for all supported image filesystems. The legacy 1.6 profile uses
 * sector_size except for exFAT, which already used 64 KiB. The value must be
 * divisible by sector_size; 64 KiB is required by the type-5 BFS sdimg path.
 *
 * LVD attach ABI and image types
 * ------------------------------
 * The kernel exposes base attach V0, extended attach V1/Attach2 and detach.
 * ShadowMount builds one complete V0 layer and marks it NO_BITMAP. source_type
 * 1 is a regular file; source_type 2 is a device/special source.
 *
 * Accepted image types and kernel names:
 *   0 Dfl, 1 GmI, 2 GmO, 3 PtcI, 4 PtcO, 5 Sv, 6 Trp, 7 Dwl,
 *   8 AcI, 9 AcO, 10 MaI, 11 MaO, 12 Pcdwl.
 *
 * Types 0/5/6/7/12 use lvdstart_vnode_direct. Types 1-4/8-11 use
 * lvdstart_vnode and resolve each secondary unit through layered bitmap and
 * optional OTBL metadata. Optimized ShadowMount profiles are:
 *
 *   .exfat                         type 5  Sv,  direct + BFS sdimg batching
 *   .ffpkg (UFS)                  type 5  Sv,  direct + BFS sdimg batching
 *   standalone .ffpfs             type 5  Sv,  direct
 *   outer .ffpfsc                 type 9  AcO, layered package outer
 *   inner .ffpfs/pfs_image.dat    type 8  AcI, layered package inner
 *
 * exFAT, UFS/.ffpkg and standalone PFS/.ffpfs use the optimized profiles above
 * only when their direct source path is under /data or /user. Other direct
 * sources use the version 1.6 profiles: type 0 for exFAT, type 7 for UFS and
 * the sector-size mapping unit for standalone PFS. The outer .ffpfsc container
 * and its nested .ffpfs/pfs_image.dat images always use optimized profiles.
 *
 * ShadowMount deliberately uses type 5 with single/save attach flags for UFS
 * images so a standalone .ffpkg on BFS can use sdimg batching. Type 7 with
 * Download Data instead favors HDD request isolation. UFS nmount has
 * no separate download-data flag: 0x10000000 is the generic MNT_NOATIME bit,
 * not an UFS or DD mode. Do not substitute GmO/PtcO only to request the UFS
 * block-map cache: that replaces direct dispatch with layered dispatch. The
 * kernel requests that cache only for type 2/4, an HDD-class regular backing
 * vnode, and a backing filesystem that is UFS.
 *
 * Type-5 BFS sdimg fast path
 * -------------------------
 * Type 5 labels the LVD provider "Ssd" and may enable BFS sdimg when the image
 * is a regular file on internal BFS and secondary_unit is exactly 64 KiB. The
 * kernel also applies platform/storage-mode and lower-provider guards.
 *
 * When enabled, lvd_worker accepts only requests whose length is exactly
 * 64 KiB and whose backing-file offset is 64-KiB aligned. It collects the
 * initial request plus up to 30 matching queued requests and submits them via
 * bfs_iosession_rw_sdimg/BfsSdimg. All other requests fall back to the normal
 * vnode path. This is block-I/O batching, not an exFAT cache or decompressor.
 *
 * For exFAT keep sector_size at 512 and create the filesystem with a 64-KiB
 * allocation unit. Setting sector_size to 65536 does not request this mode;
 * the relevant LVD value is secondary_unit. The path is unavailable through
 * MD or when the image is backed by USB/UFS/PFS/exFAT instead of BFS.
 *
 * Raw flags and validator
 * -----------------------
 * Download-data flags exist only in the LVD attach ABI. ShadowMount calls
 * /dev/lvdctl directly and normalizes wrapper-style presets:
 * raw 0x8/0x9 -> single/save-data family 0x14/0x1c;
 * raw 0xc/0xd -> download-data family 0x16/0x1e.
 * Firmware pairs raw bit 0 with read-only variants; it is not an independent
 * LVD read-only flag. The normalized validator masks are:
 *
 *   type 0,5,6,8-11: (flags & 0x92) == 0x10
 *   type 1:           (flags & 0x82) == 0x80
 *   type 2,3,4:       (flags & 0x82) == 0
 *   type 7,12:        (flags & 0x92) == 0x12
 *
 * Download Data HDD worker policy
 * -------------------------------
 * Download Data is normalized LVD bit 0x02 and is required by types 7 and 12.
 * On an HDD-class provider it makes LVD create two request workers instead of
 * one: worker 0 is labelled System (lvdhdsw), worker 1 Game (lvdhdgw). The LVD
 * start routine routes each BIO using the kernel classification byte at
 * BIO + 0x172: value 1 selects Game and every other value selects System. LVD
 * also tracks and drains the workers separately during shutdown. The flag is
 * therefore an HDD queue-isolation/QoS policy, not an on-disk-format property.
 *
 * Download Data does not select direct BIO dispatch (image_type does), enable
 * bitmap/OTBL interpretation, populate the UFS block-map cache (types 2/4),
 * unlock BFS sdimg batching (type 5), or enable PFS/compression caches. For a
 * standalone image, type 7 + Download Data is the HDD-oriented choice when
 * System/Game queue separation matters. Type 5 + Single/Save is preferable for
 * a BFS sdimg-backed .ffpkg when maximum sequential/batched throughput matters
 * and the two-queue HDD policy is not needed.
 *
 * Layer metadata and independent caches
 * -------------------------------------
 * LVD bitmap says whether a logical unit is present in a layer. V1 OTBL maps a
 * logical unit to a physical unit inside the layer file. It is unrelated to a
 * PFSC compressed-offset table.
 *
 *   LVD bitmap/OTBL       image-layer presence/remapping
 *   UFS block-map cache   backing UFS file blocks -> physical UFS blocks
 *   PFS GDDR5 ioctl       PFSC compressed offsets and optional full ICV
 *
 * The UFS cache depends on the filesystem containing the image, not UFS stored
 * inside .ffpkg, and is unavailable for BFS/PFS/exFAT backing files. The PFS
 * metadata ioctl applies to every nested image backed by pfs, ppr_pfs,
 * transaction_pfs, or a forwarding overlay; the filesystem inside the image
 * does not need to be PFS.
 *
 * PFS/PPR compression dispatch
 * ----------------------------
 * Classic pfs and ppr_pfs are distinct kernel read paths. A classic compressed
 * PFS block uses the classic PFSC header/table interpretation and the pfs path
 * dispatches its compressed payload to zlib. The PPR variant interprets the
 * PPR block metadata and can dispatch Kraken. LVD image_type, the nested
 * selector and PFS_GDDR5_CACHE_IOCTL do not select a decompressor and cannot
 * turn a classic zlib block header into a PPR/Kraken block. The image creator
 * must emit the matching on-disk block records and offset table.
 *
 * Compression is decided per block. Files excluded from compression and blocks
 * that are not smaller after compression are stored as raw blocks but remain
 * represented in the same image offset mapping. This is independent of the
 * mount-time caches described below.
 *
 * PFS compression caches and big-app reserve
 * ------------------------------------------
 * Three independent mechanisms have similar historical GDDR5/SBRAM cache
 * names and must not be treated as one allocation:
 *
 *  1. A compressed PFS/PFSC mount can allocate its own cmp_offtbl cache. The
 *     kernel message
 *
 *       pfs_allocate_cmp_offtbl_cache(): cmp_offtbl is cached
 *
 *     confirms this mount-local compressed-block offset table. It is created
 *     by the PFS mount path and is not evidence that a big-app memory reserve
 *     exists.
 *
 *  2. PFS_GDDR5_CACHE_IOCTL can be issued on a nested image's backing vnode
 *     before LVD attach when nested_pfs_index_cache=1.
 *     The ioctl asks the containing PFS/PPR read path to cache the
 *     compressed-offset table used to reach that vnode's data; it does not
 *     inspect or impose a format on the bytes stored inside the file. Thus the
 *     nested file may contain PFS, UFS, exFAT or arbitrary block data and need
 *     not itself be compressed. The hard requirement for the offset request is
 *     that the containing PFS/PPR image has its compressed-image flag set. On
 *     an uncompressed containing image the kernel logs "NOT a compressed
 *     image" and accepts the request as a compatibility no-op.
 *
 *     cmp_cache_units is a count of shared-cache allocation units, not bytes.
 *     The compressed-offset pool uses 0x10000-byte units and has 600 units
 *     (37.5 MiB) with at most eight simultaneous slots. A zero count makes the
 *     kernel derive the required count from the on-disk offset-table geometry;
 *     this is the preferred full-table/default request. An explicit nonzero
 *     count limits the reservation and can force more LRU refills. EBUSY is
 *     non-fatal: it means that this vnode already has a cache or that all eight
 *     slots are occupied. ENOMEM means that the requested units exceed the
 *     remaining total or contiguous shared-cache space.
 *
 *     The optional full-ICV request is independent. It requires the containing
 *     image's signed-image flag and usable ICV metadata; otherwise the kernel
 *     rejects that half of the request. It also has its own eight-slot pool.
 *     Neither half selects zlib/Kraken or changes the block-record format.
 *
 *  3. The 180-MiB big-app reserve is application-lifecycle memory. It is not
 *     allocated by the ioctl, LVD, PFS nmount, EnsureBigAppBudget, or a visible
 *     /dev/sbram device. During BEGIN_APP_MOUNT_EVENT the kernel allocates
 *     0x0B400000 bytes aligned to 0x200000 for selected category values:
 *
 *       0x0000F000, 0x0000F100, 0x0001F000, 0x0001F300,
 *       0x0002F000, 0x0200F100.
 *
 *     The allocation belongs to the big-app/application context. PFS can bind
 *     to it through the application lifecycle callbacks; userland is not given
 *     a buffer pointer. EndAppMount tears the context down and releases the
 *     reserve after the application pre-delete path. Consequently a managed
 *     image stack must remain mounted until the matching EndAppMount hook, and
 *     no explicit metadata-cache clear should run while its PFS vnode is live.
 *
 * For unsigned ShadowMount PFS profiles sigverify=0, so request only compressed
 * offsets (cache_full_icv=0). Signing does not make ordinary reads faster: it
 * enables integrity verification and can add work; a cached full ICV table
 * only reduces metadata lookup cost when verification is actually enabled.
 * Both compressed-offset caches are properties of the outer PFS read path.
 * They can accelerate an LVD-backed nested exFAT/UFS/PFS image because the
 * inner filesystem format is irrelevant at that layer.
 *
 * Backend and nmount policy
 * -------------------------
 * LVD is the default for every format. MD is a compatibility backend for
 * UFS/exFAT; it uses AUTOUNIT|ASYNC and configurable logical sectors (modern
 * UFS default 4096, exFAT default 512). Read-only state
 * is applied to the backing device and nmount. The shared nmount profiles are:
 *
 *   UFS   ufs + budgetid + async + noatime + automounted
 *   exFAT exfatfs + large + static-timezone + async + noatime + ignoreacl
 *   PFS   pfs + AC + game + sigverify/playgo/disc=0 + zero ekpfs
 *         + async + noatime
 *
 * The optimized profile passes only MNT_RDONLY (0x1) in nmount's numeric flags
 * argument. Legacy UFS also passes MNT_NOATIME, matching version 1.6. Generic
 * named options are decoded by the kernel as async=MNT_ASYNC (0x40),
 * noatime=MNT_NOATIME (0x10000000), and automounted=MNT_AUTOMOUNTED
 * (0x200000000). UFS options compressedfile, iochunk, largewrite and related
 * zone-aware modes are separate filesystem features and are not DD flags.
 *
 * force is appended only for explicit recovery. Unsigned PFS keeps signature
 * verification disabled. The source path selects one profile before attach;
